Contains lab4b.c, this README, and a Makefile. 
The C file takes in input from STDIN, a temperature sensor, and a button. 
It takes options --scale=, --period, and --log. It will output temperature
measurements taken from the temperature sensors at a rate specified by --period; 
otherwise the default rate is once per second. It will output the temperature
in the units specified by --scale, otherwise the default is Farenheit. It will
log all commands and output to to file specified by --log, otherwise STDOUT. 
User can input commands for SCALE=, PERIOD=, START to output commands, STOP to 
silence output of commands, and OFF to exit the program. All commands, valid
or invalid,  will be output to STDOUT or logfile if STOP has not been specified. 
Makefile uses "build" to build the executable, "check" to run the executable
and ensure it is outputting commands, "clean" to remove the executable and 
tarball, and "dist" to create a tarball of the C file, Makefile, and README.
