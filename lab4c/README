Files: This tarball contains lab4c_tcp.c, lab4c_tls.c, a Makefile, and this README. 
lab4c_tcp.c sends readings from a temperature sensor and takes in commands via the
tcp server, while lab4c_tls does the same but with a tls server. Both files take
in mandatory arguments -- host, id, and log. It also requires a port number, which
is supplied with no long argument, and is simply parsed. 
The makefile's default builds both the tls and tcp programs. Clean will remove
the executables and the tarball. Dist creates the submission tarball.
